        <div class="main-text">
            <p>A website should include <q cite="https://universaldesign.org/definition"><i>universal design that's 
            usable by all people,to the greatest extent possible,(...)</i></q> 
            (Ron Mace, 1985). While making our website, our goal was to make a minimalist website 
            that would be easy to use by all people. We started with a minimalistic design that 
            included boxes and big spaces, to make it easier to navigate for all types of viewers. 
            After finishing up, the website was run through the Wave accessibility test, 
            so we could evaluate how accessible it was. 
            </p>
            <p>We received feedback on contrast, took it with us and made sure to create better 
            contrasts both in the text and on the whole site. We made sure to highlight titles 
            and important headings. An example is that we made sure that they had bigger font-size from the regular text. By doing this, it will be easier to go through the website and find what you are looking for. This also makes the site more tidy to look at. Across the website, a clean font was used so the text was easy to read.
            </p>

            <img src="/img/our-facilities.png" alt="Screenshot of other titels from homepage">
            
            <p>Contrast is important when it comes to people that have visual impairments 
                such as blindness and color blindness. So to make better color contrasts on the website,
                we changed colors so there was bigger contrast between them. An example is a change of colors 
                on the info boxes. We did the background color darker and the text lighter. We also added alternative text to pictures to make them accessible for text-to-speech.
            </p>

            <img src="/img/contrast-after.png" alt="Screenshot of bookingpage after contrast change">

            <p>We also added alternative text to pictures to make them accessible for text-to-speech.</p>
            <img src="/img/alternative-text.png" alt="Screenshot of alternate text from CSS">
            <p>A big part of universal design is accessibility. 
                Since a web system should be usable by as many people as possible, 
                <q><i>Individuals should not have to change the way they typically interact with something.</i></q>
                (Denis Larsen, 2022) Therefore a website should be able to be used on different screen sizes. 
                To make sure our website was responsive, we used “inspect” and dragged the edges to ensure it 
                fit different screen sizes. This way we could change the CSS so it made the website more accessible.
                We also used media query and (...).
